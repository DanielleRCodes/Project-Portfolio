# Project-Portfolio

This Portfolio is a home for both of my final projects in our C# classes. The restaurant system was my first big final project and I pushed myself to learn new concepts and was very proud of the finished project. The dnd system I pushed myself to learn a new concept as well which was how to interact with web apis.
